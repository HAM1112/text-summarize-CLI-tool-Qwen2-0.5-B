The PyTorch Foundation is a neutral home for the deep learning community to collaborate on the open source PyTorch framework and ecosystem. The PyTorch Foundation is supported by leading contributors to the PyTorch open source project. The Foundation leverages resources provided by members and contributors to enable community discussions and collaboration.

Community collaboration is critical for the frameworkâ€™s evolution as well as the development of associated projects that support using PyTorch in production and at scale. As part of The Linux Foundation, the PyTorch community will also collaborate on training, local and regional events, open source developer tooling, academic research, and guides to help new users and contributors have a productive experience.
